## Introduction 
### This document is to help initialize and run your server on port 3000

## Start-Up Instructions
1. Open in Visual Studio
2. In the terminal type `npm i express`
3. Once the install is done, click test2.js and make sure you run the program with node.js
4. check status of server via the debug console. You should get a message that the server is up and running on PORT 3000
5. Go to your [local host](localhost:3000) and you should see the page being delivered to you!

## **Program specifications**

### Index.html
>This is an extremely basic webpage served here. The HTML file actually supports multiple pages which I have provided the links to. Please enjoy these memes at your discretion.

### About.html
>This page is a little bit of insight to the mental processes at work in my current day to day life. Hopefully this will change soon. This page also serves to be a bit of testing for me to see if i cna create a directory of pages to serve up. So far.... **SUCCESS!**

### Faq.html
>This particular page is designes to further test some theories in the js code. Apologize for the lack of effort on sprucing up the these pages. I might look at these again later to see if I can experiment with them later. 

### test2.js
>This is the meat of the program. I have added the FS and HTTP requires to share the files needed to host the pages. There is an inherent lack of security here, thankfully there isn't a lot to be lost/taken from here. Do note that the port is on 3000 and not 8000 as I have seen in other cases. So be sure that you are looking for that port alone.
